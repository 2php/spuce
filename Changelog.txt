Release 0.2 (2015-11-14)
==========================
-  Stable version for FIR filter design + Window design
-  Handle high pass, bandpass & bandstop transformations for FIR filters
   Some cases handled differently than others
   e.g raised cosine filters as high pass = 1 - low pass. So not highpass raised cosine
   Cut-off scaling changed for raised cosine and root raised cosine filters
-  Added fir_plot to demonstration FIR filtering capability   
-  Added window_plot to demonstration window capability
-  Added some allpass and interpolation filters to be tested in future release
